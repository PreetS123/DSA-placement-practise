Description

Ankush and sachin are friends. Ankush had a string which he "claimed" to be a palindrome, but Ankush "claims" Sachin added one character to the string now.
But you don't trust Ankush, you want to find out if he was lying about having a palindrome string.

Note: If Sachin would've added a character to the string then after removing the character the string could be or could not be a palindrome,
 but since Ankuhsh "claims" sachin added a character,
 it is also possible that sachin did not add a character.
So, find out if you can retrieve a palindrome string by deleting at most one character.
