You are given a string A, of length N.

You have to find the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to make the string palindrome.

If it is impossible, return -1.

aabcb

adbcdbad 

In the first sample test case, the given string is A = "aabcb".

After the first swap, the string becomes -> "abacb".

After the second swap, the string becomes -> "abcab"

After the third swap, the string becomes -> "abcba", which is a palindrome.

So, in 3 adjacent swaps, the string became a palindrome, so the required output is 3.

In the second sample test case, the string cannot be made a palindrome, so the output is -1.
